# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF HINDI SENTENCE

Our proposed system for sentiment analysis of Hindi sentence
review uses HindiSentiWordNet (HSWN) to find the overall sentiment associated
with the document; polarity of words in the review are extracted from HSWN and
then final aggregated polarity is calculated which can sum as either positive,
negative or neutral. Synset replacement algorithm is used to find polarity of those
words which donâ€™t have polarity associated with it in HSWN. In addition to this,
impact of the negation and discourse rules are investigated for Hindi sentiment
analysis.
